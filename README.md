# Aegis
  
 The Aegis is a keyboard that uses the same layout as the crkbd by foostan : https://github.com/foostan/crkbd
 I wanted certain features like the solenoid so I made a quick PCB that's similar in layour to a crkbd but with only one pro-micro, you can make this PCB if you want a single PCB with underglow and a solenoid, or you can take the crkbd version of the case and splap both halves into this bad boy
