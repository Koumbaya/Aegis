# Aegis
  
 The Aegis is a keyboard that uses the same layout as the crkbd by foostan : https://github.com/foostan/crkbd
 
 I wanted certain features like the solenoid so I made a quick PCB that's similar in layout to a crkbd but with only one pro-micro, you can make this PCB if you want a single PCB with underglow and a solenoid, or you can take the crkbd version of the case and slap both halves into this bad boy !
 
 ### PCB
 The PCB uses SK6812mini-E for easier soldering, but the footprints are inverted compared to most keyboards :
 here the underglow LEDs are soldered from under the PCB (facing you when you solder them), instead of being soldered from the top. 
 
 I did this because on my previous board some of the LEDs failed after that I had soldered all of the switches, meaning that to change them I had to desolder the switches.
 
 The center LED is soldered like a switch backlight led (from under the PCB, shining towards the top, through the PCB) because it's here to shine on the plate which have a logo cutout.
 
 For the solenoid you'll need 1 TIP120, 1 1N4001 diode, 1 1.1KOhms resistor and 1 5V solenoid.
 
 The footprints for the diodes are either THT or SMD.

### CASE

 
 TBC
